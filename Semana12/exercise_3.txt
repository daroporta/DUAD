USAGE OF MULTIPLE INHERITANCE

when a subclass needs to combine multiple contracts and inherit some, or all, of the 
implementation of those contracts. Multiple inheritance can be used to do strictly interface inheritance, 
when mixin classes are needed. 

REUSE CODE:  It allows classes to inheritance from multiple subclasses. It simplifies the code by reusing components
            that already exist in previous classes. However, this type of heritage leads to ambiguity if it is not
            used properly. 

COMBINE FUNCTIONALITIES: It allows to use the features of each class into a new daughter class. Which permits 
                        to create better structures that could be complex.

EXTENSIBILITY: It eases the extension of the functionalities without modifying the original superclasses.
